# Counting Cells with c-Fos Expression

c-Fos expression can occur in neurons after intense activation, and can provide information on cell growth and plasticity {cite}`barros_pattern_2015`.

Currently, manual cell counting is the gold standard. This is time intensive and often takes many weeks, as experiments can produce hundreds of images, each with hundreds of c-Fos expressing cells.

ImageJ is a tool that has been used to semi-automate cell counting. The downside of this approach is that parameters such as pixel intensity thresholds, cell sizes, and cell shapes may need to be adjusted per image. Additionally, images that contain areas of background noise are difficult to extract accurate cell counts from.

Here we explore alternative methods for performing cell counting for c-Fos expressing cells.
